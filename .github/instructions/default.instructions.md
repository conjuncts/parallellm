- After completing a feature, do NOT summarize your changes.
- Do NOT put unnecessary files at the top-level directory. For instance, one-off scripts should be placed in `scripts/`. 
- Do NOT write one-off testing scripts. When necessary, put tests in `tests/`, and use pytest.
- Be concise, especially with demo or example code.
